#Thomas Lambert

##About Me
My name is Thomas, I am originally from California, but I have moved around a bunch as a kid and I have lived here in NC for about 7 years now. My hope for my computer science degree is to eventually work on integrated systems, I have always been interested in doing small arduino projects (my favorite one was getting a poorly made 3d printer to work), so I think it would be a good career path for myself. My favorite csc class I have taken so far was CSC262, I really loved how bare bones x86 assembly is, I found it very interesting being able to interact with a computer like that. In my free time I am either playing video games, reading, drawing, or working on some project (my most recent on and off project has been trying to get my old 2011 macbook air to run a terminal only "desktop" using a linux distro since it can hardly load modern web pages lol, but I am not quite informed enough to get it all working).

##My CSC340 Goals
The thing I hope the most to get out of this class is to get a bit more of an understanding for the general workflow that is involved with software development, I have had a bit of experience with this kind of thing, but basically all of my previous expereince outside of school has been small one off projects where I never really needed things to be super organized or ever really worked with other people on a project. I also know that using git is pretty integral to just about all computer science related stuff so I hope to familiarize myself through the assignments and the project to a level where I am at least comfortable with how git works.
